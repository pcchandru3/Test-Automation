How to Identify objects from Mobile
=====================================================================

Option 1 : With Chrome and Real Device/Emulator
Go to More Tools -- Inspect Devices
We can see the connected device and we can inspect



Option 2: With Firefox
- Install user agent : Go to Tools in Firefox --> Add-Ons --> Search for User Agent and select User Agent Switcher
- Add / Import the different device setting (go here http://techpatterns.com/forums/about304.html and click on Download via Save As File Dialogue).
  It will save as an xml and we need to import that into our user agent. User Agent Switcher --> Options --> Import
- Switch to required device/agent
- Now load the site(For ex: nike.com) and use firebug
